## Who's it for?
Fungus is popular with writers, illustrators, animators and game designers, especially visual novel & interactive fiction authors. Many people using Fungus are creating games in Unity for the very first time. It is a popular choice for game jams and game design courses.
<div>&nbsp;</div>

## Free & Open Source

We believe that interactive storytelling should be accessible to everyone, so Fungus is <b>100% free & open source</b>. It works great with both the free and pro versions of Unity 3D. Fungus is inspired by other great open source storytelling tools like [Twine], [Ren'Py] and [Scratch].
