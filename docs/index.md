## Who's it for?
Fungus is popular with writers, illustrators, animators and game designers, especially visual novel & interactive fiction authors. Many people using Fungus are creating games in Unity for the very first time. It is a popular choice for game jams and game design courses.
<div>&nbsp;</div>

## Free & Open Source

We believe that interactive storytelling should be accessible to everyone, so Fungus is <b>100% free & open source</b>. It works great with both the free and pro versions of Unity 3D. Fungus is inspired by other great open source storytelling tools like [Twine](http://twinery.org), [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org) and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

The Fungus community is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Many people using Fungus have never used Unity or even made a game before, so feel free to ask questions on our [community forum]. Helping other people with their questions is a fantastic and very welcome way to contribute back to the community.
