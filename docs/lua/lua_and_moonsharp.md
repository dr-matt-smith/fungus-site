# About Lua

[Lua](http://www.lua.org/about.html) is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It is a popular language for game development and supporting user modding. The standard resource for learning Lua is [Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/1.html).

# About MoonSharp

[MoonSharp](http://www.moonsharp.org) is an open source implementation of the Lua scripting language written entirely in C#. FungusLua is basically a set of wrapper components built on top of MoonSharp which make it a bit easier to use Lua scripting directly in the Unity editor. MoonSharp does all the hard work really and is completely awesome :)

The [MoonSharp tutorials](http://www.moonsharp.org/getting_started.html) and [MoonSharp forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/moonsharp) are great resources to learn how MoonSharp works.
