# Fungus Training Course

We've teamed up with Paul Mc Grath to create an extensive [training course](https://www.udemy.com/make-interactive-games-with-fungus-unity3d-no-coding-required) which teaches how to make storytelling games using Fungus and Unity.
Sales of this course help us to continue developing Fungus, so it's a nice way to learn and support the work we're doing on this project.
