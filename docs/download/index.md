3. Launch Unity and create a new Project by selecting File > New Project.
4. Select 'Use Defaults for 2D' when creating the new project.
5. Note: Fungus can easily be used for 3D games, but our examples are primarily in 2D.
6. Import Fungus into the new project by selecting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package.
7. Display the Flowchart editor window by selecting Window > Tools > Fungus > Flowchart Window.
8. For convenience, you should dock the Flowchart window somewhere in the editor window.

You are now ready to use Fungus. To start with, try playing the example scenes and watch how the gameplay is controlled by the flowchart in the Fungus Script window.

- In the project window, open The Hunter example scene (FungusExamples > TheHunter > TheHunter.unity). 
- Press play and click through the example game.
